Willow Wood Refuge was made using the Monogame Framework

Monogame is a basic C# cross-platform framework implementing the XNA API. We chose this framework
rather than an engine like Unity in order to learn by essentially building our own engine to best
fit our game. With this in mind we created many of the libraries in this project from scratch rather
than using pre-existing libraries.

After years of war and suffering for you and your people, a few refugees have managed to escape into your
forest. Here you must help your people with nature and survive against it as you gather ingredients and
make food to heal them of their magical ailments.
